# NetScope SpeedTest Testing Assignments

This document outlines the testing responsibilities for each team member, building on the comprehensive test plan we've created.

## Overview

We've created a testing framework that allows all tests to run without Firebase service accounts. Each team member can work independently on their assigned tests without worrying about Firebase configuration.

## Team Member Assignments

### Team Member 1: Core SpeedTest Service

**Responsible for:**
- Implementing the unit tests for the SpeedTest service
- Testing result calculation and accuracy
- Testing the network detection functionality

**Key files to work with:**
- `test/unit/enhanced_speedtest_service_test.dart` - Expand this with proper mocks
- `test/unit/speedtest_models_test.dart` - Add more tests for models if needed

**Example implementations:**
- `test/examples/network_mocking_example_test.dart`

### Team Member 2: SpeedTest UI

**Responsible for:**
- Implementing the widget tests for the SpeedTest screen
- Testing the UI state transitions during tests
- Testing the gauge and visualization components

**Key files to work with:**
- `test/widget/enhanced_speedtest_screen_test.dart`
- Create additional test files for speed gauge components

**Example implementations:**
- `test/examples/mockable_widget_example.dart`

### Team Member 3: Speed Test Results and Storage

**Responsible for:**
- Implementing tests for the results storage functionality
- Testing the retrieval and display of historical results
- Testing Firestore integration using mocks

**Key files to work with:**
- `test/widget/enhanced_speed_test_results_screen_test.dart`
- `test/integration/speedtest_service_integration_test.dart`

**Example implementations:**
- `test/examples/firebase_safe_integration_example.dart`

### Team Member 4: Error Handling and Network Conditions

**Responsible for:**
- Testing edge cases and error conditions
- Testing behavior under different network conditions
- Testing offline functionality

**Key files to work with:**
- Create new test files for error cases
- Expand `test/integration/speedtest_service_integration_test.dart` with error cases
- Create network condition simulation tests

## Integration Points

To ensure all parts work together, the team should coordinate on these integration points:

1. **Service Models**: Make sure all team members use consistent model representations
2. **Mock Data**: Use the provided mock helpers in `test/mocks/` directory
3. **Firebase Structure**: Follow the structure defined in mock Firestore for real implementations

## How to Run Tests

Each team member can run tests using our provided test runner scripts:

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\test\run_tests.ps1 -unit        # Run unit tests
.\test\run_tests.ps1 -widget      # Run widget tests
.\test\run_tests.ps1 -integration # Run integration tests
.\test\run_tests.ps1 -all         # Run all tests
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./test/run_tests.sh --unit        # Run unit tests
./test/run_tests.sh --widget      # Run widget tests
./test/run_tests.sh --integration # Run integration tests
./test/run_tests.sh --all         # Run all tests
```

## Review Process

1. Each team member implements tests for their assigned area
2. Pull requests should include tests that pass with the mock infrastructure
3. Team members should review each other's tests for completeness
4. Final integration testing will be done on the combined test suite

## Dependencies

For local testing, no Firebase account or setup is needed. All tests use our mock implementations.

For future real Firebase testing, we might need to:
1. Set up a test Firebase project
2. Create a test configuration file
3. Integrate with CI/CD for automated testing
