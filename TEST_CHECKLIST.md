## Testing Guidance

1. **Unit Tests**: Focus on testing individual functions and methods in isolation

   - Create files in `test/unit/` directory
   - Example: `test/unit/auth_provider_test.dart`
2. **Widget Tests**: Test UI components and their interactions

   - Create files in `test/widget/` directory
   - Example: `test/widget/login_screen_test.dart`
3. **Integration Tests**: Test full user flows through the app

   - Create files in `integration_test/` directory
   - Example: `integration_test/login_flow_test.dart`
4. **Coverage Goals**

   - Authentication & User Management: 90%
   - Speed Test & Results: 95%
   - Traceroute & Map Features: 85%
   - Core Features & UI: 90%
5. **Important Commands**

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Generate coverage report
./create_coverage_report.ps1
```
